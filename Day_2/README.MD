# --- Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports ---  
Here I choose my comfort language, C#. Part 1 was nothing special and quite easy to do.  
Part 2 however gave me great trouble and i still dont really understand where i made a mistake.  
So i fell back to brute-forcing the solution instead, after a few hours.  
I kept the original logic commented out, maybe someone finds the bug.
