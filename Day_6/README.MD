# --- Day 6: Guard Gallivant ---
Today i choose to be brave again and try myself on F#.  
This worked kind of fine for Part 1, but i failed miserably on Part 2.  
After trying for hours, i rewrote it in C# and it worked directly.  
I dont really see the issue with the F# Part2 as well, since it gives the correct solution for the dummy input.  
Anyways, back to C#.
