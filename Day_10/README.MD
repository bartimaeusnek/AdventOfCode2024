# --- Day 10: Hoof It ---
This day was weird. I coded it with a friend ([largenumberhere](https://github.com/largenumberhere)) and we both missunderstood part one.  
Thanks to that i basically solved Part 2 before Part 1 and since it seemed like the (wrong) solution i made seemed like it would be something that could be done for Part 2, i kept it.  
And thanks to that i didnt had to redo Part 2.
