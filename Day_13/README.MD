# --- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---
(Disclaimer: This was done on Day 14)

So. Day 13 was basically just Maths. Part 1 was brute-forceable, so it was doable for me without asking an AI, googling and so on.  
For Part two i just had the idea that i *somehow* needed to make an equasion since any attempt of brute-forcing it would be wasted.  
So i took a look in the subreddit and people hinted at **Cramer's Rule**. Ok, that's a lead. First Stop: Wikipedia.   
Too bad that my math education is over 10 years old and i barely remember anything, so all the formulas on there kinda made it hard to understand.  
Next Stop: ChatGPT to get an explanation of how to apply it. And well that was successful. Even a math-dummy like me could understand what it meant.  
So back to the drawing board (my IDE) and install [Silk.Net.Maths](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) (since i already know the API of it, since ive used it a few times for graphics programming).
And voilà, there is the correct solution.  
This was exhausting.
